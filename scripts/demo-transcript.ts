  "Hrothgar King go to your flat bridge the other side who she'll probably off ready to creep the free me shouldn't kid hunter hood sit on up if you can even if you can't the guys to the back top leg switch the bottom leg out put the leg up reposition sit them back or spot mountain don't let him get away with anything all right [Music] you missed the Camorra that he's going on mulatto alright guys good I hold this you guys know what we're working on I don't know if you guys caught that video yesterday that was insane thanks again to Josh Cisneros incredible technique his little Dumbo under kimura attack from double unders pretty pretty crazy we were just playing around with it a little bit um Eddie Diaz right here um guys we're gonna show you basics now he's got the red rash guard let's go into the block out of the red and into the black we're gonna go um basic underhook what are you doing half part guys I asked my class this morning I said who in here doesn't have a half guard sweep and all of a sudden all the new guys all the white belts went I don't have a half guard sweep they don't know what to do from half guard so guys I'm gonna give you something really simple and basic I think this is great for beginners obviously when you reach higher levels not all of your opponents are gonna be are gonna fall victim to this move but on a basic level almost everybody falls victim to this move when they first start doing grappling their jujitsu okay so let me explain to beginners out there half guard gate there's a couple ways you can lock a part um the basic what I call basic half guard is his right leg is inside and it's entangled with my right leg see how he's on his side I'm on this side I attack it with my right leg see how that's all hooked yeah I mean that's pretty pretty standard there's have fun now you've got other half guards where guys will walk with the outside leg we're gonna have lockdown you know some people do an outside lockdown whatever but on a basic level guys this is your basic one cuz this foot can be used for hip escaping you can use this for hip escape and getting on your side well my right foot notice how it looks the ankle so you can do that you can go to each Hill you can go knees shield like this if you want to keep some pressure off you and the guys coming forward and keep some pressure off like this now the other stuff I can do is I can move my foot into a butterfly you know I can go in a butterfly from here well I have a half cut so this gives you some some versatility so you can do different things so I want you guys to start with this basic half part now you want to be on your side if you're an afro I want to be on my side I want to play like this either knee shield locked gate lock knee shield or open these shield but I like locked but even if I'm not using these shells at my opponents on top of me remember I want to be on my side I want to be on my side so right now my opponent has the underhood if you come around here guys look at my right hand my right hand is fencing away his hip because he's trying to like get control and I want to keep myself on my side as best I can pull that on go ahead see I like I'm breaking that grip get close like lamby yes yellow like I'm trying to be on my side right now I do not want to be flattened out weaken my neck with a cross face if he starts to get to here and you get flat see this now it's different now he's gonna kick your ass like shoulder goes into your face you're you're in trouble so look at this right here I mean like let's say he's about like where he is right now I can stiff on this I can bridge and move his head watch I move his head boom and I get on my side I get my V shielded see that I could get a frame now I can go from where he had the underhook Lucknow yeah to where I create a frame see that now I'm playing a half guard now you actually are playing half guard instead of getting crushed in a course like this okay so if you're here you know I might use my elbow I might use my forearm at first and blitz smash and I'm like I'm trying to look before it's too late I move his head and I get on my side I got the power for my play you see the foot basics instead of lockdown which is great nothing wrong we're going basic see I hold their most my foot move his head get on my side lock my next brave it away boom we get into here now the beginners of the world put pressure on you they lay on you and they try to smother you now when he tries to do that we're gonna skinny hit him with the basics I'm gonna take my knees shield I'm gonna pop it out and sweep my under hook in watch out my elbow I wanted to show you this right here Brian look at this it's a little dark over here we're not much light do we let see my knee my knee is here I have a frame and my elbows connected to my knee you see that now when my knee pops out I catch the underhood did you see that and I can even take his arm and I can kick it like above me like not away from me but like if you put pressure full yeah so I can't you pull it and now I can wrap around the waist now go around and look at that see that I got that deep grip around the waist my opponent goes for the over hook or the wizard also called the lizard and now I'm on my elbow okay now combatives me if this was a fight your idea would be keep your head glued to him if he tried to hit you with this right now he can't because he's wizard if he tries it you with your left with the left I could keep weight on see that as I start to get up so every time I'm doing this it makes him Whizzer me back down and we're in this fight what's called the dog fight it's coming up to the dog fight now come around here fly and look at the legs next all we do guys watch this I do a little switch I take my outside leg and I bind his angles so from here I go like that to there what I don't do is I don't go like this let go and try to do this because during this time you can renew your foot just know once you like your foot just what you got right there and he's gone okay or akin these slice if you guys do this study right click back so you guys gotta watch that so watch this I watch I forget even my foot there spot and make sure I get that vibe once I did that vine you see Eddie's in a good position still threshing if I ever need the student I can scoot away on treasure like I can scoot no circle this way if I ever need to I can adjust if for example he started like putting weight head over there a little bit over here yeah like like I'm starting to fall on my back said I can like scoop and keep my position now during this time I got my outside leg hook my inside leg this one can get out now I do that not by being polite and not by going excuse me can I get this foot out please you don't move around him you take your leg and you move right under him like this see that put my leg up and now even if he puts his leg up which he made i pushed towards his butt this way no keep this on you do it yeah I take him that way the plane come back up now if he's wizard me forward you don't want to be here trying to trying to fight like this put your foot up and sit back and take him there if he's on his knee sit back you can attack them if anytime your hair can reach the ankle seize down and I can go here anytime you can you grab that you grab taking them down and then we're looking to pass either to the mouth that's what I would love to get I always want to get them out if he doesn't give me the mount i take side control okay so watch out here we're in half guard okay if he's flat and I have the under he can't he can't wait until I crush you remember that don't wait until he crushes you let's go ahead let's assume I'm here but I haven't crushed you completely do a little remember you're gonna count regime' by head as he moves me get society and go Nishio and then he can frame break my grips block my biceps blocking punches if it's real he's block yeah you can just frame right here you open up your knee shield right there now you've got a good frame and now even if I'm doing this you're gonna pop that under her goal and now I come back for the wizard guys now looking that's good I like that he's going hips up but he still has his hook in there's lots of options we can do but right now he's gonna go top leg switch so go back go to the back let me get how that top leg switch the top leg up next what's going on if I'm on my knees I hear he's pushing towards me but it's all just gonna push the back towards my butt look at that once he takes me to here two guys it's all over if I'm grappling right here I'm gonna probably accept that I can't Whizzer anymore and I'm gonna think about my next technique whether it's get guard or some kind of kind of funky counter but at but my point is I'm no longer trying to fight him with my wizard like a wrestler would this point I'm gonna scramble to something else because I can't win this at this point I've got to play a different game and get back into the garden you know move from there so now he's on top of me we can do it drill okay the guys on top see how I'm here I moved the hip and get my nice shape are you trying to lock me up this is okay to see look at my hand coming inside i frame boom i break it away i'm playing a little these shoulder to elbow to knee connection kick the leg get the unhook let's see that position with it I'm kicking my leg up I whip this leg guys with it come on up if you can't that's okay top leg switch bottom leg out okay lots of techniques right here I've got left arms I've got all kinds of fun for us later on but the basics bring my foot look from here I'm pushing bring my foot and sit him back look at that put it right there on his butt I'm walking this knee right now I'm gonna step right over see that I cover that his legs tried to develop guard I'm not allowing it I'm cross facing and I'm walking on up and we're gonna be in attack mode now okay right there so one time one time one time quick one time but I like it it's very simple very simple you can even if you can't guys top leg switch bottom leg out put the leg up reposition sit them back towards us but mountain don't let him get away with anything all right hope you guys hope you guys enjoy this is your basic half guard sweep guys I think there's lots of half guard sweeps but I think that this game then I'm going to be going over with all the little trails you can kind of go off of the main trail are going to be the bulk of your half guard game for most people some people have great flexibility some people are really strong they have different things they can do this is good for most everybody okay most everybody sure there's locked down and we'll go over lock down too but this is probably best for the average okay the average guy out there okay hey like it okay okay you got anything to say you want to tell anybody something go train drill you got it I got it yeah we all do we all do guys I just came back from the jujitsu United for a cause to help prevent cancer we raised a bunch of money over at Matt Baker School in Bakersfield Bakersfield
